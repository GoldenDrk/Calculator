<h1><u>Calculator with React JS</u></h1>

With this calculator, you can also use a converter for weight, ditance and temperature! Concerning the calculator, you'll see a keyboard icon at the top of the screen. Hover it to see that you can click it and use your own keyboard for the calculations!
If you use CodeSpaces to open the repository, use <i>$ npm run preview</i> command in the terminal to visualize it in a seperate browser tab locally. You may also need to run <i>$ npm run build</i> beforehand.
